While the power will attempt to match the next to inherit it to your gender, if you have no offspring that match your gender it will be inherited by the eldest child and the rules will apply to them. If you inherit this power and your biological parent of matching gender has died, it will pass on to your child by the same rules or firstborn if you have no children yet.

You have three base runes.

2nd. Personal rune. This allows for names and will only work if a name is applied to it. If, in any case, a name of an individual is on it, then the effect will take hold and prevent any interest in the object or things labeled on it. This is considered a strong rune, but can be more and more diminished if more names are applied.

3rd. Requested rune. This rune is applied to valuable objects and will restrict the person that applied the rune from gluttony in the applied object. Let's say, you apply it to a piggy bank. This will restrict the flow of money from the bank for specific reasons and prevent over spending. One must apply the applications reasoning for this to be effective.",0

Make sure to get a coin counting machine!

3. World’s mysteries: unlock mankind’s greatest mysteries! “if If I had a dollar for every time Jesus resurrected”, “If I had a dollar for every time the FBI organized the murder of JFK”, “If I had a dollar for every alien buried in Area51”. 

4. Secrets. Use the power to reveal some of the most sordid secrets of people you know. “If I had a dollar for every time my mother had sex with the milkman”, “If I had a dollar for every time my best friend thought about fucking my girlfriend”, “If I had a dollar for every time my son smoked weed”.

You can customize the color: Red, White, Blue, Purple.
You can send lightning through your body so you can run like the Flash, but don’t expect to run at the same speed. Your reaction time will be 7000x as quick, however. You will have lightning immunity, control the weather to a certain degree, and the basics. 

On a normal cloudy day, your power will be strong enough to destroy an entire house, 4-7 shots depending on the build of the house. 

On a sunny day, with no clouds, your power will be dampened. You will only be able to destroy a tree. You cannot pull any lightning from the sky, hence you are at a very weak state. You can still send lightning through your body, however. 

On a normal rainy day, your power will be stronger. You will be able to destroy an entire skyscraper, quite possibly multiple ones depending on the rain. The lightning you pull from the sky can destroy an entire city. 

On a stormy day, your power will be much stronger. You will be able to destroy an entire city with a few shots, depending on the size. The lightning you pull from the clouds will be able to destroy 2 solar systems. 

On a thunderstorm day, your power will be tripled. You will be able to destroy up to 10-20 cities, depending on the thunderstorm’s power. The lightning you pull from the clouds will be able to destroy 7 solar systems.

On a supercell day, you are able to destroy an entire continent or two. Because of the intense electric activity, the lightning you pull from the sky can destroy up to 5000 solar systems!!!

... however. Let’s say you take a trip to Jupiter, a planet full of thunderstorms and screeching winds. Your lightning will be so overwhelmingly powerful that you will be able to destroy up to 5 planets!!!!
The lightning you pull from the planet can destroy up to 6,000,000 galaxies!!!! Let’s also assume you become angry because you lost a match in a game. Well, using your anger and hatred, you become capable of destroying an entire universe. Drinking Mtn Dew on top of that allows you to destroy an entire multiverse. 

This power is quite destructive and if it is used in the wrong hands, expect the whole planet to be destroyed sooner or later.

However, this power, if used in the right hands, can allow civilization to advance by centuries. You can destroy meteors and have each lightning spread to each debris, wiping out a meteor with 99.99% accuracy.
